# School

A) Considering the structure of a school, create the diagram that describes the
domain model and relationship between entities. Some of the possible entities
may be Principal, Employee, Student and Janitor. Try to apply the concepts of
Hierarchy, Abstract Class and Interface.

Answer:
    This is the diagram, this could be a possibility of the model, assuming 
    the Principal and the Janitor have a different behavior or attributes 
    from Employee. If they don't have a different behavior it can be done by 
    just adding a rol attribute to the Employee class.
